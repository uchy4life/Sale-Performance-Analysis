# Sales Performance Analysis Project

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of sales performance by examining various KPIs that impact overall business success. 
The KPIs included:
- Total Sales and Cost Analysis: Analyzed the total sales and associated costs to determine the overall profitability of the business.
- Profit and Profit Margin Calculation: Calculated profits and profit margins across different product categories and departments, providing insights into the most profitable areas.
- Sales by Product Category, Store Type, Store City, and Location: Conducted a detailed breakdown of sales performance based on product categories, store types, geographical locations, and store cities to identify trends and growth opportunities.
- Sales by Promotion Analysis: Evaluated the effectiveness of promotional campaigns by comparing sales data before, during, and after promotional periods.
- Profit Margin by Product Category: Assessed the profit margin for each product category, helping to prioritize products with higher profitability.
- Unit Sales Analysis by Department: Analyzed unit sales by department to understand demand fluctuations and optimize inventory management.
- This analysis provided valuable insights to enhance decision-making, optimize sales strategies, and improve overall performance.
## Steps for Analysis: 
- Data Preparation: Load the data, check for missing values, and clean the dataset.
-  Gender Analysis: Investigate sales by gender.
-  Education Analysis: Explore how education level relates to sales.
-  Sales by Country: Compare sales across different countries.
-  Visualization: Visualize results using bar charts.
-   Statistical Testing (Optional): Perform hypothesis testing to check if the demographic variables significantly affect sales.
